# Multi threading on NXP LPC17xx

This is a very simple multi-threading solution on NXP LPC17xx. This means you can create multiple threads on NXP and my logic will do the scheduling and context swtiching for each thread.

I did this because I wanted to see my theory works in real. This is not a ful implementation, it misses some important features like: thread ID, storing the return value of thread, thread status, more advanced scheduling, custom stack address + size handling, MPU, etc.

This repo builds on [LPC1769 LPCXpresso board](https://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpc1769-lpcxpresso/).
